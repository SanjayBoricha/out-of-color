## Description

***Out of Color*** is a classic tower defense game where players must place turrets to defend against increasingly difficult waves of enemies, players have 3 different ammos which they can **Mix & Match**. As the game progresses, enemies grow stronger and faster, testing your strategy and quick thinking.

This game was made with ❤️ in the **Godot Engine**, and we hope you enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed creating it!

### Controls
- **Mouse**: Click to place turrets, click to change ammo type.

### Objective
Place turrets along the path to stop waves of enemies from reaching your base. Each wave will become progressively more difficult. There are 4 levels with around 20 waves each, survive as long as you can to defend your base.

## Features

- **Classic Tower Defense Gameplay**: Simple core mechanics you already know of in tower defense games.
- **Multiple Turret Types**: 2 different types of turret with their own unique ability, so choose wisely.

- **Different ammo types**: Rather than turrets, we went with an ammo focused gameplay, currently there are 3 different colored ammos available with their own status effect.
